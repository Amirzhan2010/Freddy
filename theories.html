                <h2>Freddy</h2>
                <p>The safety rules hanging on the wall in the Corner of the Eastern Corridor read:
                    "Don't touch Freddy," however, no other animatronics are mentioned there. Freddy also has a handprint on his muzzle... Perhaps someone was fighting him off? 
                    Fans of building theories note that the palm prints coincide with the location of the paws of the Freddie's on that poster where he's twisting his head off. However, despite this co-ownership, Freddie has only four fingers, and the fingerprint has five.</p>

                <h2>Foxy</h2>
                <p>The most obvious answer.
                    After all, Pirate's Cove is marked "UNCOVERED."
                    In addition, the naked eye can see that Foxy has the sharpest teeth, and some fans insist that the fox's jaw is dislocated.</p>

                <h2>Golden Freddy</h2>
                <p>Least likely candidate.  He has the same handprint on his face as regular Freddy.  It looks like he, like Foxy, is out of order - just a suit without an endoskeleton.
                    BUT if, when setting the activity level of animatronics in Your night, you enter 1-9-8-7, who will appear in front of you?  Golden Freddy. Very suspicious.</p>
